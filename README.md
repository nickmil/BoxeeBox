# AMX Control Module - Boxee Box & Pre-Eden XBMC

This module uses an HTTP RESTful API to control Boxee Box set top boxes
Further documentation will be provided in the future.  It will work with Boxee Box, as well as Pre-Eden releases of XBMC.
With the release of Eden, XBMC has moved to a JSON API.

This module is provided free of charge with no warranty or guarantee of functionality.
Please refer to the Demo AMX workspace for guidance on implementation.
